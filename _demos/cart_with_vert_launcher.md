A moving cart launches a ball vertically. The ball lands back in the launcher because it has the same horizontal velocity as the cart.

### Equipment ###
- Cart with vertical launcher
- Ball bearing

### Instruction ###
1. Push the ball bearing down into the cart's launcher and a rod will emerge at the bottom.
2. Place the pin through the hole in the rod to hold the launcher steady.
3. Put the cart in motion then pull out the pin. The ball bearing will launch vertically.
