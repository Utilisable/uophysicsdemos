An air track demonstrates frictionless 1D travel as well as 1-D frictionless collisions

### Equipment ###
- 2 metre long air track
- Air pump
- Flexible hose
- Power cable
- Extension cord
- Gliders (with magnets/pins)
- Motion detectors and computer/software

### Instruction ###
Place air track on a flat, level surface. Adjust feet screws to level the track. Connect hose from pump to track and turn on pump. Adjust pump speed as necessary. Demonstrate frictionless travel and/or collisions using gliders.
