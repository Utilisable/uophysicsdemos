A hunter spies a monkey in a tree, takes aim, and fires. At the moment the bullet leaves the gun the monkey lets go of the tree branch and drops straight down. Does the hunter's bullet hit the monkey?
To simulate this experiment, a ballbearing is aimed upwards at a suspended metal disc. When the ballbearing is shot, the disc is released. The ballbearing will hit the disc because their vertical acceleration is equal.

### Equipment ###
- Monkey (Metal plate in front of his body is for hearing the sound of impact)
- Projectile Launcher (barrel modified for a 3/8" ball bearing)
- Arduino Uno
- Electromagnet
- "C" clamp with post
- 2 quick-grip
- Power cord
- Power bar
